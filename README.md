This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript bug: a NullPointerException occurring within a TimerEvent handler. The issue arises when a variable (myVariable in this example) is unexpectedly null, leading to a runtime error. The solution involves adding a null check before accessing the variable's properties or methods.
